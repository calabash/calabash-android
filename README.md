Calabash-Android
================
Calabash-Android lets you run [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) features on your Android device or emulator. A Cucumber feature could look something like this:

    Feature: Login feature
      Scenario: As a valid user I can log into my app
        Given I am a valid user
        And I enter my username
        And I enter my password
        And I press "Login"
        Then I see "Welcome to coolest app ever"

You can run your Calabash features on multiple devices using [LessPainful.com](https://www.lesspainful.com).

### Documentation
The documention is split into the following sections:
* [Installation](documentation/installation.md)
* [Ruby API](documentation/ruby_api.md)


Generate a Cucumber skeleton
------------------------
To get started with calabash it might be a good idea to run `calabash-android gen`. It will create a Cucumber skeleton
in the current folder like this:

    features
    |_support
    | |_app_installation_hooks.rb
    | |_app_life_cycle_hooks.rb
    | |_env.rb
    |_step_definitions
    | |_calabash_steps.rb
    |_my_first.feature

In this skeleton you find all the predefined steps that comes with calabash. Try to take a look `my_first.feature` and change it to fit your app.

Writing a test
--------------
The Cucumber features goes in the `features` library and should have the ".feature" extension.

You can start out by looking at `features/my_first.feature`. You can extend this feature or make your own using some of the [predefined steps](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/blob/master/ruby-gem/lib/calabash-android/canned_steps.md) that comes with Calabash.

Running test
------------
To run your test:

    calabash-android run <apk>

Calabash-android will install an instrumentation along with your app when executing the app. We call this instrumentation for "test server". The "test server" has special permission that allows it to interact very closely with your app during test.
Everytime you test a new binary or use an upgraded version of calabash a new test server will be build.
The test server is an intrumentation that will run along with your app on the device to execute the test.

### Screenshot location
Screenshots are placed in the current working directory by default. The location can be changed by setting the `SCREENSHOT_PATH` environment variable.

    SCREENSHOT_PATH=/tmp/foo/ calabash-android run

would cause the first screenshot to appear at `/tmp/foo/screenshot_0.png`.

Predefined steps
-----------------

The predefined steps are located in the `features/step_definitions` folder. A compiled list of predefined steps with comments is available [here](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/blob/master/ruby-gem/lib/calabash-android/canned_steps.md)

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Problems clicking on buttons and text

If it seems that buttons/text aren't being clicked properly, you need to add the following xml to your AndroidManifest.xml:

```
<uses-sdk android:targetSdkVersion="SDK_VERSION" />
```

Where SDK_VERSION is the version of the Android SDK you are using. Version numbers can be found [here](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html)

For example, Android 4.0 uses version 14, Android 4.0.3 uses version 15 and Android 4.1 uses version 16.
