Location steps
--------------
If you allow your phone to use mocked locations (configured on your device under development settings) and your app has the `ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION` permission you can change the perceived location of the device by using any of these steps.


You can change the location any address or named location. This is done using the [geocoder gem](http://www.rubygeocoder.com/).


    Then /^I am in "([^\"]*)"$/ do |location|
    Then /^I am at "([^\"]*)"$/ do |location|
    Then /^I go to "([^\"]*)"$/ do |location|

To use a set of concrete GPS cordinates

    Then /^I am at ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+), ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)$/ do |latitude, longitude|
    Then /^I go to ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+), ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)$/ do |latitude, longitude|

Internationalization
--------------------

	Then /^I press text of translated l10key "([^\"]*)"$/ 
Simulates that the user pressed the text of the l10nkey.	

	Then /^I press button of translated l10key "([^\"]*)"$/
Simulates that the user pressed the button with the label text of the l10nkey.

	Then /^I press menu item of translated l10key "([^\"]*)"$/

	Then /^I wait for the translated "([^\"]*)" l10nkey to appear$/ 
Waits until the text of the translated l10nkey is displayed.

Note: you can assert or press interface elements using [Android's String resources](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.string.html) by passing a package in a custom step:

    perform_action('press_l10n_element', 'ok', nil, 'android')
