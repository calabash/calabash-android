      to stay backwards compatible with generated skeletons.

      The concept of a Device has been introduced. It will handle all setup
      and communication with physical devices or emulators.
      The device class is needed because we want to interact with more than
      one device at the same time from Calabash.

0.1.0:
      Added support for testing Xamarin Mono for Android apps.
      Currently only Release builds are supported.
