0.2.0.pre1:
      The concept of a Device has been introduced. It will handle all setup
      and communication with physical devices or emulators.
      The device class is needed because we want to interact with more than
      one device at the same time from Calabash.

0.1.0:
      Added support for testing Xamarin Mono for Android apps.
      Currently only Release builds are supported.
      This new version requires you make changes in
      features/support/app_life_cycle_hooks.rb.
      The first time you execute "calabash-android run" upgrade instructions
      will be displayed.

0.0.19:
      take_screenshot now works with Ruby 1.8.7

0.0.18:
      Fixed bug. HTML text fields are now cleared when using set_text.

0.0.17:
      Upgraded to Robotium 3.3

0.0.16:
      Clears text when calling set_text in a webview.
      Added set_text helper method to support.

0.0.15:
      Prefixes screenshots with feature name

0.0.14:
      Added 'calabash-android submit'
      Will submit your apk and features to www.lesspainful.com

0.0.13:
      Added missing file EnterKey.java

0.0.12:
      Added "I press the enter button" step

0.0.11:
      Added a small delay after executing cucumber from calabash-android-run
      to make termination prettier.

0.0.10:
      Added -v and --verbose options to calabash-android run.
      This will turn on verbose logging for Calabash as well as Cucumber.
      Default logging is much less verbose now but can be even better.
0.0.9:
      Moved from Robotium 2.5 to 3.2.1
0.0.8:
      Added colors to Cucumber output

0.0.7: Output from the ant build and from running Cucumber is now in sync.
       That means that you can now trust that the output you see is actually
       the most recent output from ant or Cucumber.

0.0.6: Introducing the CHANGES file
