# Release notes for calabash-android 0.5.4
 
This version is only a fix of changes introduced in 0.5.3
 
**Fix** handle the old usage of `clear_text` better. `clear_text` was changed in 0.5.3 and `clear_text_in` is the new equivalent method. Notice that `clear_text_in` now only clears the text of the first view found, not all. To replicate the old behaviour, use `query(query, setText: '')`
