# Release notes for calabash-android 0.5.11

**Change** the way Calabash-Android (re)signs applications:

Use the encryption of the supplied keystore, and always use SHA1 as the digest algorithm. This is equivalent to how Android Studio behaves. If given a keystore with the signing algorithm SHA256withDSA, Calabash-Android will sign an application using SHA1withDSA.
