# Release notes for Calabash-Android 0.8.1

These are the changes introduced in 0.8.1 in comparison to 0.8.0

**Fix** WindowManagerService detection when the current Activity is not completely initialized. This would cause queries to fail. Issue #766.

**Fix** Queries for qualified classes were being cached. This means that if a consecutive query for a specific class was executed before the class was loaded, it would continue to return no results.
