Location steps
--------------
If you app has the `ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATION` permission you can change the perceived location of the device by using any of these steps.


You can change the location any address or named location. This is done using the [geocoder gem](http://www.rubygeocoder.com/).

    Then /^I am at "([^\"]*)"$/ do |location|
    Then /^I go to "([^\"]*)"$/ do |location|

To use a set of concrete GPS cordinates

    Then /^I am at ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+), ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)$/ do |latitude, longitude|
    Then /^I go to ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+), ([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)$/ do |latitude, longitude|


Rotation
--------

These steps do nothing if you run them locally. 
If you run the test on [LessPainful](https://www.lesspainful.com) they will actually rotate the physical device.
