### 0.9.11

The TestServer.apk in 0.9.10 had a fatal bug.

In 0.9.11, the TestServer.apk has been fixed.

This provides preliminary support for running against Android Q
devices.  In Android Q beta 4 we know that the test server would
not start on Android Emulators.  The workaround is to test on
devices.  We believe Q beta 5 will contain a fix for this problem,
but we have not tested this.

### 0.9.8

No behavior changes in TestServer.apk.

This release allows Calabash Android to be used with json 2.0
and cucumber 3.0.  This will also allow users to update
their ruby to 2.5.x.

Test Cloud users will need to pin their ruby version to
2.3.x and the json and cucumber versions.  To your Gemfile
add the following:

```
gem "json", "1.8.6"
gem "cucumber", "2.99.0"
```

Test submitted to Test Cloud with json > 1.8.6 and cucumber 3.x
will fail validation.

* Support latest Cucumber versions #878
